# Use this property to specify which architecture you want to build.
# You can also override it from the CLI using
# ./gradlew <task> -PreactNativeArchitectures=x86_64

# Use this property to enable support to the new architecture.
# This will allow you to use TurboModules and the Fabric render in

# Use this property to enable or disable the Hermes JS engine.
# If set to false, you will be using JSC instead.

# API URL Configuration for Release Builds
# 
# IMPORTANT: If you're getting network errors in release builds, uncomment and update these
# to point to your development server. Replace 192.168.1.12 with your computer's IP address.
#
# To find your IP address:
#   macOS/Linux: ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
#   Windows: ipconfig
#
# Uncomment these lines and update the IP address:
# API_BASE_URL=http://13.203.161.24:4000/v1
# AI_SERVICE_URL=http://13.203.161.24:3001/api
#
# For production, leave these commented to use the default production URLs:
# https://api.yourcare.com/v1
# https://ai.yourcare.com/api
#
# After updating, rebuild the app:
# cd mobile && npm run build:android

# Enable Vision Camera frame processors for high-speed capture (30 FPS)
# Frame processors enable real-time frame capture for accurate vital signs detection
# Set to true to enable frame processors (requires react-native-reanimated and react-native-worklets-core)
